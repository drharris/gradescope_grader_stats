# Gradescope Grader Stats
Userscript to add per-grader statistics on submissions in Gradescope

## Installation
First, you need some type of userscript extension on your browser, such as GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey.

Next, Navigate here: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/448892-gradescope-grader-stats

You should be able to click the installation button on that website to install this.

## Operation
On Gradescope, viewing the list of question submissions should automatically display the per-grader statistics at the top

## Bugs/Suggestions
While I'd prefer to keep this script simple, if you have any problems or suggestions within the scope of this script, please open an issue here on Github.
